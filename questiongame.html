   <h1> What is the Javascript here doing? <br> I have seven small pieces of code here that make up my question game.</h1>
    <h2> One </h2>
         <p>The first two lines of code are variables I am declaring here to keep
         a counter for the number of question the user gets right, and a string
         that I will be adding to later to give the user a response unique to the
         questions the user answered incorrectly</p>
    <h2> Two </h2>
         <p>Here I defined a new object that I will use to store my questions and
         the associated properties, as well as a method used to compare the user
         response to the intended answer of the question. This method also adds to
         my counter in order to keep track of the number of correct answers the user
         has accumulated.</p>
    <h2> Three </h2>
         <p>I created three new objects of the type created above.</p>
    <h2> Four </h2>
         <p>I created an array and populated it with the objects I created above in
         order to have those objects associated with an index number.</p>
    <h2> Five </h2>
        <p>This is an alert greeting the user.</p>
    <h2> Six </h2>
         <p>This is a for loop that cycles through my array and, for each object,
         prompts the question, defines the user answer. The loop then runs the method
         created earlier in order to determine if the user was correct and to run
         an alert notifying the user. This loop runs through my entire array, asking
        all questions stored there. </p>
    <h2> Seven </h2>
        <p>This final alert uses the variable counter I had created earlier to notifying
        the user about the number of questions they answered correctly. It also
        prompts an alert with a variable holding a response to each question answered
        incorrectly. This alert is held in an if statment. If the user got less than 100%,
        the first alert displays. If they got them all right, the else statement alert displays.</p>
    <h2> Who am I? </h2>
        <p> My name is Selena Flannery, and I am a returning student just leaving
        the hospitality industry. I am studying Neurobiology and environmental science,
        and hope to continue my schooling next fall at a program in Norway. I am
        a musician and an actor, and those have always been my passions. I love
        books, movies, games and music, and have a particular fondness for horror.
        I live in Bellevue with my longterm boyfriend, three cats and a lizard,
        and spend a vast majority of time taking care of my mother. I am really excited
        to be here. </p>
